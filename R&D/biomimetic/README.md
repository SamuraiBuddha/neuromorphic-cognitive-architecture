# R&D Biomimetic Research Archive

This directory contains biomimetic research and development work migrated from the tool-combo-chains repository as part of the architectural reorganization.

## Structure

- `memory/` - Core biomimetic memory management components
- `mcp/` - MCP server implementations for biomimetic systems
- `experiments/` - Experimental implementations and prototypes
- `docs/` - Research documentation and design notes

## Purpose

The biomimetic approach served as a crucial stepping stone in our evolution toward neuromorphic cognitive architecture. While we've moved beyond strict biological mimicry to leverage silicon's strengths, these components represent valuable research and development insights.

## Integration with Neuromorphic Architecture

These biomimetic components informed the design of our neuromorphic systems, particularly in:
- Memory organization patterns
- Context management strategies
- Adaptive learning mechanisms
- Multi-modal data integration

## Historical Context

Migrated from tool-combo-chains repository on 2025-07-05 as part of architectural cleanup to focus that repository on proven MCP_Docker + Memory (Ref) + Neo4j patterns while consolidating R&D efforts in the neuromorphic architecture repository.
